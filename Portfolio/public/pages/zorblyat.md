  "description": "During the 2024 Global Game Jam I along with 4 other team members teamed up to develop Zorblyat. We each had a different task to do while making the game, I was responsible for building an upgrade system that let the player increase their speed and score multiplier.\n\nI also worked on the online leaderboard for the game, we used a service called lootlocker and used a premade script included in the package to get it all working.\n\nI did however have to do some modifications to get it working with our account and also to both send the correct information to lootlocker and display it."
