title: Fork Kebab
date: May-2024
description: >-
  This is my submission for the Devs That Jam 36hr challenge on the 25th of May
  2024. It's a game where you can make your own 'fork' shish kebab out of
  various foods and score points depending on how well you drop them onto the
  fork. I used multiple assets online for my art, music, and sounds. The rest of
  my time was spent making the game function and developing solutions that would
  make my idea work.


  I got many positive reviews during the Jam, my game was ranked in the top 10
  on several categories.
