title: Sound Of War
date: May-2022
description: An fps game I made with my team at the University of Westminster.
  It's a first person shooter inspired by cod zombies where you kill tons of
  enemies to progress through rounds and fight harder enemies that spawn in
  higher frequencies. The player doesn't have a lot of ammo in their disposal
  and will feel encouraged to pick up and use more weapons. The game was made in
  a 10 week time frame with a 3 week break in the middle. I earned free gift
  cards at the end of development
